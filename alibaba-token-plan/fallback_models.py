# GENERATED file - do not hand-edit. Source: the measured Token Plan catalogue

# Regenerate upstream and copy this file over to update.
#
# Personal and Team have DIFFERENT catalogues and the sk-sp- key prefix is identical
# for both, so the tier cannot be detected from the key.
#
# PREFER live /models over these lists. Verified 2026-07-21 with active keys for both
# tiers: /models is tier-aware, so live discovery gives each user the listed
# entitlement without needing to detect the tier. Known callable-but-unlisted
# IDs are retained separately because exact-ID inference can be available even
# when Alibaba omits an ID from /models.
# These static lists are the OFFLINE FALLBACK for when the probe fails. PERSONAL is the
# safer default there, since nobody is offered something outside its tier catalogue.
#
# Always handle 'Access to model denied' at call time regardless: a LAPSED subscription
# still lists its full catalogue on /models and then denies every completion.

# PERSONAL: 9 chat models
